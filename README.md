# Graph Representations and Algorithms Comparison
Implementation of two graph representations and few algorithms with comparison of how fast they perform.

Author: Bartosz Rodziewicz

The task done as a second project for Algorithms and Computational Complexity (Struktury danych i złożoność obliczeniowa, yes, that is official English translation).

The task was to implement a way to store graphs in the app using these two representations:
* Incidence Matrix
* Adjacency List

And implement 5 following algorithms:
* Minimum Spanning Tree
	* Prim's algorithm
	* Kruskal's algorithm
* Shortest Path
	* Dijkstra's algorithm
	* Bellman–Ford algorithm
* Max Flow
	* Ford–Fulkerson algorithm
		* with depth-first search
		* with depth-first and breadth-first search

Using STL or Boost libraries was taken as a disadvantage.

My app covers the most basic solution so I implement both ways of storing graphs using STL structures and two algorithms:
* Prim's algorithm
* Dijkstra's algorithm
